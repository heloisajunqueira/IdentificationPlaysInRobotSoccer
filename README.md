# IdentificationPlaysInRobotSoccer

This work is based on the theory of trajectory prediction in crowds, allied to the modeling approached in Multi-Agent Systems.
The environment chosen for the application of this proposal is robot soccer, approaching the modeling of plays considered to have a high potential of scoring goals by the opposing team. 
In this proposal, the analysis of 3 robot soccer teams was carried out: Ri-One, ITAdrois and Helios. Achieving the main objective of this work, present the proposal of a tool that through the classes of moves, which uses modeling through state machines, and using neural network, is obtained the prediction of moves in robot soccer.
